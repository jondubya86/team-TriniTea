    trinitea_philosophy_intro:
     'In the beginning was the leaf, and the leaf was loose and without water. And TriniTea saw this and said, "it is not good that the leaf should be alone. Let there be tea." And it was so and tea is good. Tea Philosophy is the civilized solution for living within an often chaotic world. It is the forum where harried people gather to pause, relax, and share conversation over tea. Via Tea Philosophy, we all learn how to breathe again. And this is good. Let there be tea.'

      description:"Gyokuro, a shade grown steamed green tea, is among the finest of Japanese teas. While the young leaves of the spring season develop, the Gyokuro plants are shaded from sun for several weeks. This slows the growth allowing, tea leaves more time to develop depth and flavor. The sun-deprived leaves are higher in chlorophyll, which explains their vivid green color. They're also higher in amino acids, most notably L-theanine, which accounts for the perfectly smooth, rich and soft flavor. Our fine Gyokuro green tea produces a deeply sweet aroma of freshly buttered greens and seaweed, with no grassiness or harshness. Think of tender new grass just sprouting in the spring. Soft on the palate with a balanced, delicate finish. Energizing and soothing cup of tea. Use lower water temperature and enjoy multiple infusions to get the most from this tea. Product of Japan.",
